[Sad]Now the US President Donald Trump's tariffs are complicating global trade,
[Sad]with critics calling them arbitrary and not based on economic reality.
[Neutral]The latest round takes effect today with tariffs on wood products.
[Neutral]Trump says he wants to protect the domestic forestry industry.
[Sad]Current countries that have already signed trade agreements with the US,
[Sad]like the EU, the UK and Japan, will face only the general tariff rate of 15%.
[Sad]Meanwhile, Trump has taken aim at China's dominance in world shipping,
[Sad]imposing new port fees on Chinese ships that dock in US ports.
[Sad]Beijing has responded with its own charges for US vessels.
[Sad]The port of Long Beach.
[Sad]The US charges a fee every time a Chinese-built ship docks at any US harbor.
[Sad]$50 per tonne if it's owned by a Chinese company,
[Sad]and $18 if it's owned by a non-Chinese company.
[Sad]The fee will increase each year for the next three years.
[Sad]It's a first-of-a-kind measure meant to counter China's shipbuilding dominance
[Sad]and protect American shipyards.
[Sad]This dominance is real.
[Sad]Data from the UN shows that China delivered 54.6% of all new ship capacity in 2024.
[Sad]The next biggest producer is South Korea.
[Sad]This means a huge portion of the world fleet could be affected by the US fee.
[Sad]Well, it's an absolute first that we see a country introducing docking fees
[Sad]on Chinese-built ships.
[Sad]And we expect a heavy impact on the shipping market.
[Sad]The first activity you will see is that ships built in China
[Sad]will go out of trade from the United States.
[Sad]In other words, carriers will reroute vessels to avoid US ports.
[Sad]There are plenty of other trade lines for those ships,
[Sad]but the disruption will be significant.
[Sad]The shipping data provider AlphaLiner warned in September
[Sad]that the US port fees could cost up to $3.2 billion next year
[Sad]for the world's top 10 carriers.
[Sad]Meanwhile, China has announced retaliatory measures.
[Sad]Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals
[Sad]and ships built in the US or flying the American flag
[Sad]would be subject to a $56 per net tonne fee per voyage if they dock in China.
[Sad]All right, let's talk about this with Cassandra Sunt from DW Business
[Sad]and co-host of DW's business podcast, The Dip.
[Sad]Good to see you, Cassandra.
[Sad]First of all, let's talk about the impact.
[Sad]How much of an impact are these tit-for-tat docking fees likely to have?
[Sad]Yeah, I want to underline how dominant China is in the shipbuilding industry right now.
[Sad]Just under 55% of ships built last year were built by China.
[Sad]Compare that to 0.1% that were built by the US, right?
[Sad]That's one tenth of 1%.
[Sad]The difference here is really massive.
[Sad]And this has been a long-term trend from the Chinese side.
[Sad]So when you're looking at fleets that are operating around the world,
[Sad]even if the company itself is in Chinese,
[Sad]there's a good chance that a lot of those ships were built in China.
[Sad]Not to mention there are many big companies that are operated by China itself
[Sad]that are in the shipping business, right?
[Sad]So when we're thinking about a company that is sending a ship,
[Sad]one of these really big container ships,
[Sad]and let's say it has 10,000 of these containers on board,
[Sad]the fees right now could top a million US dollars.
[Sad]And these fees are also, let's not forget, set to increase every year through 2028.
[Happy]So with tit-for-tat tariffs,
[Sad]essentially the fees being more or less one for one from both sides,
[Sad]we're really escalating here.
[Sad]We're talking about big money.
[Sad]This is of course all happening, isn't it,
[Sad]as the two leaders, President Trump and the Chinese President Xi,
[Sad]are getting set to meet in the coming weeks.
[Sad]So what does this all mean for the talks between the two leaders?
[Sad]Yeah, global trade, I think because sometimes these shipping containers
[Sad]move where we don't see them,
[Sad]we forget how much shipping is a part of this.
[Sad]80% of global goods trade moves on the water.
[Sad]So when we talk about things moving across borders,
[Sad]we're talking about the shipping industry here.
[Sad]So this is a really big impact in terms of setting the stage.
[Sad]One president of the World Shipping Association said that
[Sad]US fees and the counter fees from China
[Sad]risk harming exporters, producers and consumers
[Sad]at a time when global trade is already under pressure.
[Sad]So US President Trump,
[Sad]he's tried to downplay some of the tensions with China here.
[Sad]He posted on social media over the weekend,
[Sad]don't worry about China, it will be fine, with three exclamation points, right?
[Sad]But that was only days after he was threatening 100% tariffs back on China.
[Sad]And after China tightened export controls for rare earth minerals.
[Sad]So when we're thinking about this talk,
[Sad]that's going to happen likely at the end of the month.
[Sad]That's a few weeks away, but a lot can change in that time.
[Sad]And what I'm going to be really interested to see
[Sad]is how much these two sides have learned about the others negotiating tactics
[Sad]over what I think we can safely call only the first year of this trade war.
[Sad]Right. Now on top of the docking fees,
[Sad]we've got this 10% US tariff on lumber, haven't we?
[Sad]Just tell us a little bit more about that.
[Sad]Yeah, so it's 10% on raw lumber and 25% on finished goods.
[Sad]And it's really today's kind of a double fee kind of a day here.
[Sad]But when we're thinking about raw wood,
[Sad]that's going to hit Canada the hardest because the vast majority
[Sad]in terms of value of raw wood that the US got last year was from Canada,
[Sad]about 11.5 billion USD there.
[Sad]But when we're talking about finished goods,
[Sad]things like furniture, bathroom cabinets and so on,
[Sad]the top three countries for those kinds of goods
[Sad]are Mexico, Vietnam and number one is China.
[Sad]So that's really going to affect the housing market.
[Sad]Sure, folks aren't going to necessarily in the US buy furniture so often,
[Sad]but they are going to notice this increase.
[Sad]But what I've been reading from analysts and industry insiders
[Sad]is that this is going to affect the housing market
[Sad]because sure, you need cabinets and bathroom vanities
[Sad]and so on to finish the house.
[Sad]But the US lumber is a big part of that.
[Sad]So if your lumber costs as a construction company are increasing,
[Sad]things could slow down.
[Sad]And that runs counter to what US President Trump promised,
[Sad]which is more affordable housing for Americans.
[Sad]So we're talking about significant ripple effects.
[Sad]Cassandra Sunt from DW Business.
[Sad]Cassandra, thank you so much.
